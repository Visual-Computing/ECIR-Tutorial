- [Format and Schedule](#format-and-schedule)



## Introduction
This tutorial presents advanced methods for efficiently searching and exploring large visual datasets, addressing the increasing demand for high-performance visual retrieval systems as multimedia content grows exponentially.

We will begin by covering the principles of **large visual encoders**, emphasizing techniques for generating and improving compact, high-quality general-purpose visual descriptors. Next, we will explore strategies to enhance **cross-modal retrieval**. Participants will gain insights into **approximate nearest neighbor search methods**, with a focus on **graph-based approaches** that maximize search efficiency in dynamic datasets.

In addition, the tutorial introduces innovative **visualization techniques for high-dimensional data**, such as **grid-based sorting**, which enable intuitive navigation and exploration of extensive image collections.

Hands-on exercises provide practical experience with the concepts discussed using **Jupyter notebooks** and **interactive demonstrations**. This tutorial will equip researchers, practitioners, and students in **information retrieval, computer vision, and data science** with both basic and advanced skills to efficiently search and explore large visual datasets.
